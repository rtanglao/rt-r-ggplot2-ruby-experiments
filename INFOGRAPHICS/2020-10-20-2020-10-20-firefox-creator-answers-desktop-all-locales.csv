I disabled the extension and in Preferences/Search selected Google to once again be my default search engine. But, when I do a search, Duckduckgo comes up as the default, and when I look in Preferences/Search it again shows as the default. I went back into extensions and totally removed Duckduckgo, reset Google again as the default but it reverts to Duckduckgo. I went into One-Click Search Engines and removed Duckduckgo, but then when I try to select my default search engine there are no search engines from which to choose. I clicked on Restore Default Search Engines but then I'm back to Duckduckgo being the default search engine. I've spent hours searching online with no success. How do I get rid of it and get Google back as my default? I'm using Firefox 82.0 on an iMac running Catalina. I updated to 82.0 hoping that might solve the issue, but no luck. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",philmguy

So I chose the file and clicked to download it; then the confirmation popup appeared, and it said the file was coming from ""<a href=""http://xtom.com"" rel=""nofollow"">xtom.com</a>"" (I'm looking at it now from the Firefox Library, but I don't think that was the website... It was something else, I think...). A little while after the download started, the whole computer drastically slowed down, and I couldn't open the download tab in Firefox, I could open everything else, for example, the Bookmarks menu or the Overflow Menu, but, specifically, not the Downloads tab. It then finished, and I promptly deleted the downloaded file on Explorer. The Download tab still wouldn't open; then I restarted Firefox.

I want to keep them even though I rarely read is just the nature of the newsletter. So I have 5 filters set up to redirect them into their own sub folder and also be marked as read. </p><p>This have been working fine for years now without issue. But about 3-4 weeks ago I started to notice the newsletters would show up in my inbox. I would try and run the filters from the menu option and nothing would happen with the messages so I went into the filter panel and noticed that only these 5 filters were uncheckmarked so was why they were not working. So I rechecked them and ran the filter again and worked fine and I thought that was it. But few days later same thing the messages again showed up in my inbox rather then sub folder so this time I went right into the filter panel and same thing only these 5 were unchecked so rechecked and ran the filters. </p><p>It seems to be almost a daily routine. I am going to try and remove them and then re-add them and see if that fixes it but if not does anyone know of this issue with thunderbird and is there any solution just in case redoing the rules does not fix this. </p><p>All the other filter rules work fine never unchecked is just these 5 which just so you know all come from the same site just different language course as comes from languagepod101 just each filter is a different language but all the same base website. </p><p>Thanks </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scottish2

Although I haven't had a reply, I managed to find out how to perform the scanning operation from within the Firefox for Android app (V81.1.4).  I set up all the permissions for the app in Settings and thought I was on my way to achieving the result when I found the 'Scan' symbol just above the search bar and tapped that.  The QR scanner duly opened and scanned the code and I 'Allowed' the app to open the link.  The page that opened announced: 'Pair using an app' and below it asked: 'Did you use the sustem camera? You must pair from within a Firefox app.' I repeated the exercise several times but got the same result. I do not understand why this is happening and why I cannot sync across my devices any more.  It seemed to work fine without much intervention from me in the past, but since the recent upgrades the app is equally dysfunctional across all my devices. I sincerely hope that someone out there is able to set me straight. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jackgeorge15

Был момент, когда Firefox выдал окно с запросом сертификата, но был выбран ""не тот"", который нужно. При повторных запусках - данное окно более не появлялось (почему?). В настройках безопасности - Сертификаты - установлен режим ""Спрашивать каждый раз"" но окна с выбором сертификата не появляется. Firefox отправляет первый попавшийся сертификат, сервер его не принимает, возникает ошибка защиты.
