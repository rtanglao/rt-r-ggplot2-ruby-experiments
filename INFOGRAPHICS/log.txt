(My computer did not work any faster).  Thankyou Philip Perry Hello. Two days ago i recieved an option from Firefox to click on to get firefox add on/update in order to speed up my computer. It said my bookmarks would be saved. However they have now disappeared. I wanted to delete the firefox update so I tried System Restore to go back to my original settings. However this did not work and I am still without my bookmarks. How can I remove the firefox update and go back to my original settings. (My computer did not work any faster).  Thankyou Philip Perry "

[1] "Recovery of bookmarks from mobile browser after desktop formatting I managed to explode my computer this weekend and I lost, among other things, my bookmarks in Firefox. They can't be recovered from windows.old as Windows somehow decided to replace the old windows.old by a new one with nothing useful in it. I still have all my bookmarks in my account, though, which I know from looking at my Android phone. Now, I'm just scared that if I sync, they will get deleted from my phone instead of synced back to my computer. I could not find any specific answer to this; can someone help me? Do I have anything to do to make sure it goes the right way? Thanks! "

[1] "corrupted update 10/20/20  I clicked on the update button last night - running 81.0, and the update was for 81.0.2.  When  I went to open the browser all that I got was a line at the top - FF would not open.  I backed up the profile, and did a clean install.  When I finally got the backed up profile installed, it opened properly once and everything was there. When I opened it again, no book marks, and none of the buttons worked.  FF didn't close properly, and I had to use Task Manager to shut down. I ended up downloading the beta version, and it's worked just fine.  The original profile works, so all bookmarks are there. I see that FF released 82.0 this morning.  Is it safe to try to install it, or is the beta version that I installed last night really 82, just hours before it was officially released? "
